      <h1>About Website</h1>
      <p>This is a personal website where I keep these trinkets I’ve made. It feels nice to have a place where I can display them together. The site is just a github page with a custom domain, all the webpages are built statically from scratch. I had fun learning and messing around with html, css, and js. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><img src="noah.png" width=128 height=128 class="textInsert"><img>
        I’ve recently been stuck in a memory.
        It's like a rerun of my favorite tv show, quietly playing in the background of my mind.
        The sound isn’t always clear, and I only catch bits and pieces of each scene, but I can still feel the impact of the moments.
        The warm familiarity of something I used to love,
        Or the painful touch of past mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, I used to go into these existential anxiety spirals, where I would wonder why I can consciously experience my life but no one else's.
        Like why was I me, why am I the one who has to experience the world through this body.
        And even now, talking about this, there's this impact at the back of my mind scratching its way through my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        This itchy, fuzzy crack between what I would describe as myself and everything else.
        A crack that opens into an infinite abyss of a billion worlds, each with their own minds and lives.
        I’m alone here in my planetary system looking up, reaching out, trying to touch the stars.
        Thinking, am I worthy of existence, am I decent enough for a place in someone else's world?
        Or am I just more dark matter, invisible, existing with no color or purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
        I made and did things, because I wanted to fill in the details of my abyss.
        I wanted to be someone, and have proof to back it up.
        If someone ever said, “You're not smart.”
        I could always point to the high level math class I took and assure myself, no they’re wrong.
        If they said I wasn’t creative, I could read the poetry I wrote.
        Or if they said I was uncoordinated, I would tell them I could ride a unicycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept thinking eventually one day I would be detailed enough.
        But no, of course I’m still afraid, still afraid of the abyss.
        Perhaps this whole train of thought only speaks to me being a perfectionist, or a “vulnerable narcissist.”
        But it doesn’t matter much now, what matters is what I do next despite this anxiety.
        I can't destroy or ignore it, so I might as well indulge its quest.
        So look and listen friend.
        I’m here to shout my heart out into the void, waiting for my name to echo back.
      </p>
